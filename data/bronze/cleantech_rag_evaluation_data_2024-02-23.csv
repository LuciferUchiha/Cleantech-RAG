12,11,Why are milder winters detrimental for grapes and apples?,"Since grapes and apples are perennial species, they have adapted to consistent climate patterns and have fine-tuned their winter responses to help them enter dormancy in the fall at the right time, and break bud in the spring at the right time. As our winter's get more mild, they are also getting more erratic. It is very difficult for growers to mitigate these sorts of large-scale swings in temperature.",https://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=33040

Federal illegality also means we don’t have access to state and federal tax-credit programs [such as the Inflation Reduction Act]. Investors are much more attuned to that degree of risk. After all, if a company can’t restructure, it has to fail.”",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/08/high-time-for-solar/#comments
